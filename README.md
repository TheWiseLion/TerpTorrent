#TerpTorrent
=============

Final Project of CMSC417 - Computer Networking

**Made Fall 2013** - Over the span of two weeks.

I've left all my "design docs" here, with spelling mistakes and all. 

Supports many of torrents sub-protocals (e.g. <href=http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html>DHT</href>).

Specs: https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification

There is plenty of resuable segments (e.g. b-encoder) if your looking to build something similar.

Here is text from old readme:

Src -> pure source

BitTorrentProject -> eclipse work space

java doc -> java doc in html format


LionsShare.jar -> should be executable jar that runs the torrent client 
(I think its cross platform, Java 7. Definitely worked on windows)
