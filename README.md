TerpTorrent
===========

Final Project of CMSC417 - Computer Networking

Fall 2013

Programmed over the span two weeks. I've left all my "design" docs in, with spelling mistakes an all. 
Supports many of torrents sub-protocals.

There is plenty of resuable segments (e.g. b-encoder) if your looking to build something similar.

Here is text from old readme:

Src -> pure source

BitTorrentProject -> eclipse work space

java doc -> java doc in html format


LionsShare.jar -> should be executable jar that runs the torrent client 
(I think its cross platform, Java 7. Definitely worked on windows)
